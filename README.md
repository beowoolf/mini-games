# mini-games

An application written in Java that can become a collection of several mini-games. The first mini-game that has been
implemented is Lottery. In a while, maybe I'll add another mini-game to the app, and then another, and another.
Appropriate application architecture was important in the project.

Lottery mini game scenario:

1. The user enters 6 numbers.
2. The draw takes place.
3. The screen displays the drawn numbers and those provided by the user, along with information whether he managed to
   win.

Lottery mini game scenario:

1. The console displays 6 random numbers between 1 and 99.
2. When writing the application, I focused on simplicity.
3. Available handles forbidden situations, in which the user receives information that, for example, he has entered a
   negative number or a number outside the range.
